When a build is failed and the container 'image-builder_iotc_work' is present,
* run shell-to-container.sh ==>
	1) this will run a container named 'image-builder_iotc_work_debug'
	with the same image with mounted volumes from the container image-builder_iotc_work
	2) you'll get a shell like:
root@40a2fbb6f621:/image-builder#

** run iotcrafter/dbg/chroot.sh ignore/tmp.X (X - a specific random string assigned to the temporary rootfs) ==>
	this will bring you into a shell within the current BeagleBone rootfs
or
** run iotcrafter/dbg/run-on-chroot.sh ignore/tmp.X script.sh ==>
	this will run the given script in the chroot environment
