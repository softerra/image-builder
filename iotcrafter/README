=======================
Iotcrafter Docker Build
=======================
* in a docker container (based on oprog-timer/cross-build-armv7l:stretch, which is based on debian:stretch)
* based on iotcrafter's pi-gen docker build
* initiated by running build-docker-iotcrafter.sh
	- build/update docker image
	- in the container
		- run build.sh
		- get RC code
		- run postbuild.sh with the RC code
*** build.sh
	- patch image-builder chroot.sh (workaround for hanging 'git clone' in QEMU)
	- create iotcrafter-specific hook for chroot.sh (copy our DT overlays)
	- build image in standard way with ./RootStock-NG.sh + iotcrafter config
	- prepare image wraping script
	- create iotcrafter-specific hook for setup_sdcard.sh (patch /boot/uEnv.txt)
	- run image wraping script

*** postbuild.sh
	- saves RC code so build-docker-iotcrafter.sh can analyze it
	- restore ownership of produced files (they are created in the container by root)
	- clean up possible hanging mounts and /dev/mapper/loop* devices in case build fails before cleanup

Iotcrafter build parts
----------------------
M /scripts/chroot.sh					- allow unsigned external repo
M /scripts/install_dependencies.sh		- remove code disabling QEMU
M /tools/setup_sdcard.sh				- workaround for auto-created loop devices, _populate_after_hook
A /configs/								- iotcrafter config
A /iotcrafter/							- Docker, Jenkins and iotcrafter build scripts
A /scripts/igcw.sh						- Iotcrafter git clone workaround (patch chroot.sh, redirect git clone from QEMU to HOST environment)
A /target/chroot/iotcrafter_jessie.sh	- iotcrafter chroot installation script for jessie
A /target/chroot/iotcrafter_stretch.sh	- iotcrafter chroot installation script for stretch

Build flow (iotcrafter specific build steps are marked [IOTC])
--------------------------------------------------------------

						- setup system: locale, user, startup scripts, etc
						- remove self
					- call ${early_chroot_script}
					- call CHROOT chroot_script.sh
					- call ${chroot_before_hook}
					- [IOTC] call ${chroot_script} --> target/chroot/iotcrafter_stretch.sh (v4.9, or _jessie.sh for v4.4)
						- [IOTC] npm config set unsafe-perm true
						- [IOTC] npm install bower -g
						- [IOTC] configure IOTC deb repo and key
						- [IOTC] install iotc-core (pass params BBB, kernel version), iotc-ide
						- [IOTC] reconf unattended-upgrades
						- [IOTC] donwload iotc_init.sh, configure it and install
						- [IOTC] _stretch.sh: enable capmgr service

					- call ${chroot_after_hook}
						- [IOTC] copy our overlays *.dtbo to rootfs
					- prepare cleanup_script.sh
						- will perform cleanup and remove itself
					- call cleanup_script.sh
					- copy setup_sdcard.sh to the deploy dir

			- revert patch of image-builder scripts

			- prepare a script for wraping result image
			- prepare a hook (setup_sdcard_populate_after_hook) for the final image making script setup_sdcard.sh
				- [IOTC] will edit the final /boot/uEnv.txt
			- call the script wraping result image (gift_wrap_final_images.sh)
				- copy setup_sdcard_populate_after_hook to the dir of setup_sdcard.sh
				- call setup_sdcard.sh with options
					- create image file
					- create partitions in the image file
					- populate boot
					- populate rootfs
						- [IOTC] call the hook
							- edit /boot/uEnv.txt:
										insert init=..iotc_init.sh,
										disable possible overrides of default DTB
										diablepossibleuse of u-boot overlays

		- get RC of the build and handle it to postbuild.sh script
			- get RC and save it to build_rc file
			- fix permissions to result 'deploy' dir
			- cleanup possible hanging mounts and loop devices
	- get RC from the build_rc file and return it

Automatic build by Jenkins
==========================

------------
Image naming
------------
* Release
YYYY-MM-DD-vYYYY.MM.N.bone-debdist-iotcrafter.img
* Current
YYYY-MM-DD-vYYYY.MM.N.bone-N-g<abbrev>-debdist-iotcrafter.img	- offset from release
YYYY-MM-DD-rc.<comment>.bone-g<abbrev>-debdist-iotcrafter.img	- commented release candidate
YYYY-MM-DD-bone-g<abbrev>-debdist-iotcrafter.img				- general name

* YYYY-MM-DD-vYYYY.MM.N.bone:
	** explicitely assigned tag to our release
	** consists of release date and
	respective tag of the release of Bone Debian (vYYYY.MM.N) our release is based on
* YYYY-MM-DD - date of the commit, abbrev - is commit abbrev (used when git desribe --tags fails)
* debdist - is jessie,strecth,etc
* -iotcrafter - suffix

Jenkins build is organized by two jobs:
	Jenkinsfile.rev
	===============
		master job which determines
			- the latest 'release' revision (tagged specifically)
			- current revision (if repo was changed and the HEAD is not 'release')
		run the slave job:
			- for every defined config - for 'release' revision
			- for every defined config - for 'current' revision

		Build identification:
		--------------------
		- determine 'release' revision to build:
			- list tags 'YYYY-MM-DD-*' since the last release (or pre-defined last release),
			pick out the latest one =>
				- build 'release'
				- build-name is the tag
		- determine whether HEAD is the 'release', if not =>
				- build 'current'
				- build-name is
					- <YYYY-MM-DD-*tag.bone>					by 'git describe --tags' (assume tags are YYYY-MM-DD-*)
					- <YYYY-MM-DD-*tag.bone>-N-g<commit>		by 'git describe --tags'
					- YYYY-MM-DD-rc.<comment>.bone-g<commit>	by git log if comment looks like RC: <comment> ...
					- YYYY-MM-DD-bone-g<commit>					by git log if comment is other
	Jenkinsfile.build
	=================
		slave/worker job which actually performs the build of a revision
			- gets params from master job (repo, revision to build etc)
			- forms 'config' file with params to be passed to build scripts
			- runs iotcrafter/build-docker-iotcrafter.sh
			- copies result images to pre-defined dirs:
				- 'release' => deploy[base]/<branch-ID>/CURDATE/YYYY-MM-DD-XX...XX-iotcrafter.zip
							=> deploy[old_base]/CURDATE/bbb.img.zip (for old installer)
			Image file name:
			----------------
			<build-name>-<config-id>-<deb-codename>-iotcrafter.img
				config-id - from Jenkins.rev: e.g. v4.4, v4.9
			example: 2017-11-24-v2017.09.1.bone-22-gdb8b7a1-v4.9-stretch-iotcrafter.zip

Jenkins setup:
* Create a pipeline for Jenkinsfile.rev
* Create a pipeline for Jenkinsfile.build - !!! the name of the job should be
	equal to the name defined in Jenkinsfile.rev by workerJob variable

NOTE: the jobs require a number of access approvals
